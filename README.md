 # Histology Image Classification Based on GCN
 
 In this project, we try to classify histology images based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN).
 The first step would be to prepare the inputs of GCN. In order to prepare the inputs of GCN, we need to convert the image to graph. In this graph each cell or nucleus would be a  node and cellular interaction would be considered as edges.
